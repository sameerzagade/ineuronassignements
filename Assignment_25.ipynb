    "1) What is the difference between enclosing a list comprehension in square brackets and parentheses?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Square brackets [...] create a list comprehension that immediately constructs a list with all the computed values. This is useful when you need to store all values in memory and access them multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parentheses (...) create a generator expression that produces values lazily. This is useful when dealing with large datasets or when you want to conserve memory by processing elements one at a time."

    "2) What is the relationship between generators and iterators?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Iterators:\n",
    "\n",
    "An iterator is an object that implements the iterator protocol, which consists of the methods __iter__() and __next__().\n",
    "The __iter__() method returns the iterator object itself. This is required to allow the object to be used in a for loop or other iteration contexts.\n",
    "The __next__() method returns the next value from the iterator or raises the StopIteration exception if there are no more values to be generated.\n",
    "Iterators are used to create custom sequence types that can be iterated over, like lists, tuples, and strings.\n",
    "Iterators maintain their state and position, allowing you to pause and resume iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators:\n",
    "\n",
    "A generator is a simpler way to create an iterator using a function-like syntax. It allows you to define an iterable sequence using a function and the yield keyword.\n",
    "A generator function contains one or more yield statements. When the function is called, it doesn't execute the whole function body immediately; instead, it returns a generator object.\n",
    "Each time the yield statement is encountered, the function's state is saved, and the yielded value is returned. The function can be resumed from where it left off when needed.\n",
    "Generators are memory-efficient because they produce values on-the-fly and don't store the entire sequence in memory.\n"

    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    A generator function in Python is recognized by the presence of one or more yield statements. The yield statement is what distinguishes a generator function from a regular function.\n",

    "4) What is the purpose of a yield statement?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "The yield statement in Python is used in the context of generator functions to define a point at which the function will yield a value to the caller. The purpose of the yield statement is to create a generator that can produce a sequence of values on-the-fly while maintaining its internal state between iterations. This allows you to iterate through a potentially large sequence of values without having to generate and store all the values in memory at once."

    "5) What is the relationship between map calls and list comprehensions? Make a comparison and contrast between the two.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Both map calls and list comprehensions are ways to transform and process elements in a sequence (like a list) in Python. They serve similar purposes but have differences in syntax and behavior. Here's a comparison and contrast between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarities:\n",
    "Transformation: Both map calls and list comprehensions are used to apply a transformation to each element of a sequence.\n",
    "Functional Approach: Both approaches follow a functional programming paradigm, allowing you to perform operations on sequences without explicitly writing loops.\n",
    "Conciseness: Both approaches are concise and can often result in more readable code compared to traditional for loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences:\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "Map: The map function takes a function and an iterable as arguments. It applies the function to each element in the iterable and returns an iterator over the transformed values.\n",
    "List Comprehension: A list comprehension consists of an expression followed by a for loop that iterates over the elements in a sequence, optionally followed by filtering conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return Type:\n",
    "Map: The result of a map call is an iterator. To get a list, you need to explicitly convert it using the list() function.\n",
    "List Comprehension: The result of a list comprehension is a new list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function Application:\n",
    "Map: You provide a single function that is applied to each element of the iterable. This makes map more suitable for scenarios where you have a predefined function to apply.\n",
    "List Comprehension: You can include any expression (including conditional expressions) in a list comprehension. This allows more flexibility in terms of the operations you can perform on the elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Readability:\n",
    "Map: While it's concise, the use of a separate function for the transformation might make the code slightly less readable for simple operations.\n",
    "List Comprehension: The concise syntax directly shows the transformation logic inline, which can enhance readability, especially for straightforward transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function vs. Expression:\n",
    "Map: Requires a separate function to be defined before use, even for simple operations.\n",
    "List Comprehension: Expressions are defined directly within the comprehension itself, making it more suitable for one-off or simple operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance:\n",
    "Map: May be slightly more memory-efficient for large datasets since it produces an iterator that yields values on-the-fly without creating a new list.\n",
    "List Comprehension: Creates a new list in memory."
